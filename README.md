## Real-Time Weather Data Processing System

### Description
This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline that ingests weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it using Spark, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is orchestrated using Airflow.

### Tech Stack
* Kafka
* Spark
* Airflow
* PostgreSQL
* Docker
* OpenWeatherMap API

### Project Structure
* `data`: Stores input and output data
* `src`: Contains Python scripts for data processing and pipeline components
* `docker`: Dockerfiles for building images
* `airflow`: Airflow configuration files

### Getting Started
**Prerequisites:**
* Python 3.6+
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Apache Airflow

**Setup:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-data-pipeline.git
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file with the following environment variables:
   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```
3. Build Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
4. Start Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Running the Pipeline
The Airflow UI will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/. Navigate to the `weather_data_pipeline` DAG and trigger it.

### Data Pipeline Overview
The data pipeline consists of the following steps:
1. **Data Ingestion:** Weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API and pushed to a Kafka topic.
2. **Data Processing:** A Spark streaming job consumes data from the Kafka topic, performs necessary transformations, and writes the processed data to a PostgreSQL database.
3. **Workflow Orchestration:** Airflow orchestrates the entire pipeline, ensuring proper execution and scheduling.

### Data Processing
The Spark job performs the following tasks:
* Parses incoming JSON data
* Extracts relevant weather information
* Cleans and transforms data for storage
* Calculates derived metrics (e.g., temperature averages, wind speed)

### Future Improvements
* Implement alerts for abnormal weather conditions
* Explore machine learning models for weather prediction
* Enhance data visualization capabilities
