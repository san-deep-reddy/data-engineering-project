# Open Weather API Data Engineering Project

Project Title: Real-Time Weather Data Processing System
Description:
This project demonstrates the construction of a real-time weather data pipeline using Kafka, Spark, Airflow, and PostgreSQL. Weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API, processed, and stored for analysis.

Tech stack:

Kafka: For message queuing and real-time data ingestion.
Spark: For data processing and transformation.
Airflow: For workflow orchestration and scheduling.
PostgreSQL: For data storage.
Docker: For containerization and environment management.
OpenWeatherMap API: For weather data.
